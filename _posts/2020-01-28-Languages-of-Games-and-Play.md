**Invitation.** 
We cordially invite you to attend the PhD defense of Riemer van Rozen on Wednesday February 19th at 10:00 am at the Agnietenkapel. Riemer is going to defend his thesis "Languages of Games and Play: Automating Game Design & Enabling Live Programming".

Following the defense, we organize a mini-symposium on Live Game Design. We invite you for a lunch (a warm meal), short talks by distinguished speakers and drinks at Hotel Casa.

## Short Talks

### Talk 1: Procedural Generation Using Linear Constraints
**Abstract.** Procedural content generation problems sometimes involve systems of linear equality and inequality constraints among the elements being generated. Cassowary is a constraint solver designed for solving these types of constraints at interactive speeds. It is widely used in user interface toolkits, and multiple implementations are available. To date, Cassowary has not been used in procedural content generation. This talk presents Cassowary and gives examples of its use in procedural content generation.

### Talk 2: Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Modern Computer Games

**Abstract.** As the complexity of Modern Computer Games increases, the value of their Model-Based Design becomes apparent. By using most appropriate modelling formalisms, at appropriate levels of abstraction, by explicitly quantifying the notion of "playability", and by automatic exploration of the space of possible game designs (and in particular, of Non-Player Character behaviour), many alternatives can be explored virtually, and games can be synthesized. Some personal experiences with Model-Based Design of Modern Computer Games will be presented.

### Talk 5: Breathing Life into Domain-Specific Languages
**Abstract.** Live programming is a technique to shorten the feedback loop between editing a program and its execution. For domain-specific languages (DSLs) the gap between the program and how it is executed at run time can be even bigger than for general purpose languages such as Java. In this short talk we will highlight the main challenges for bridging this gap and showcase early research results in breathing life into DSLs.
