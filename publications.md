# Deliverables
Here we will share the output of the Live Game Design (LGD) project.
We categorize scientific output along the lines of conference papers (full research papers), artifacts, workshop papers (short preliminary research papers), posters, presentations and workshops.

# Previous Projects
Automated Game Design (AGD) was a two year RAAK-MKB project that ran from June 2013 until June 2015, and extended to November 2015.
Early Quality Assurance (EQuA) in Software Production was a four year RAAK-PRO project that ran from June 2011 until November 2014, and extended to February 2015.

## Full Papers
Here we share full research papers such as conference papers and journal papers.
