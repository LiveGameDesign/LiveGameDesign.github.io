## Improving Debuggers for Procedural Game Levels
Quinten Heijn and Riemer van Rozen participated in the International Conference on the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG), in Malmö, Sweden in August 2018.

Their talk at the Procedural Content Generation in Games (PCG) workshop, a part of FDG, was for a paper on Measuring Quality of Grammars for Procedural Level Generation [1].
It was written in the context of Quinten's MSc project, which was in collaboration with Joris Dormans of Ludomotion.

Following a very interesting related topic presented by Tom Smith on generating graphs for Zelda-style levels via Answer-Set Programming,
Riemer gave an introduction into Software Evolution which framed the talk, an unusual perspective for games research.
According to Antonios Liapis, Joris was virtually present too.

It&#39;s a Software Evolution approach for root-cause analysis in PCG, cool for explainable AI for white-box PCG?

Analyzing the output of content generators is a key challenge, but determining root-causes of quality issues in the source code of the generators is another.

Quinten presented the main contributions of the paper, showing movies of LudoScope Lite, a prototype level generator and analyzer he built (currently limited to tile maps), which is available on [[github]](https://github.com/visknut/LudoscopeLite).

In good company, we see Rafaël Bidarra on the left and Julian Togelius on the right.

The movie below demonstrates a simple example game level of a dungeon room.
The player has to traverse the room without being burnt by fire pillars.
However, luckily players can use water from a pond to extinguish the flames.

The movie below shows how LudoScope Lite generates the tile map that conforms to each of the properties on the right.

LudoScope Lite is a prototype that demonstrates two techniques that developers can use to analyse the root causes of quality issues in generated levels.
First, the Metric of Added Detail (MAD) raises flags for grammar rules that remove detail with respect to their position in the transformation pipeline.
Second, Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR), analyzes level generation histories against level properties and reports problematic grammar rules.

The movie below demonstrates how SAnR finds broken levels. This facilitates debugging and can be used to prevent bad levels from being generated.

### Conclusions
Specification Analysis Reporting (SAnR) in particular may prove very useful, since debugging grammar rules in level generation histories is an important requirement for improving the quality of grammar-based content generators.

Are MAD and SAnR odd names? Well, yes, but simultaneously debugging grammar rules and potentially countless levels feels MAD, and therefore becoming SanR must be urgent.
In that light, the results game developers achieve using generative grammars are not just good, but astonishing. Apparently one can develop an intuition of effects that enables steering for quality, even if debugging facilities are lacking or completely missing.
This cutting-edge technology explores the limits of procedural content generation, and it deserves the attention of researchers who can help developers push those limits forward.
