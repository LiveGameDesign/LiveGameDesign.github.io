**Invitation.** 
We cordially invite you to the afternoon Symposium on Live Game Design, which will be held at the Volkshotel in Amsterdam on Wednesday February 27th.
[Together with game businesses, students, lecturers and researchers](/partners) have worked on applied research on *Live Game Design* for three years.
At the concluding symposium, we will present project results and discuss next steps.
We hope that you will join.
Registration is mandatory but free.

**Date:** Wednesday February 27th, 2019.

**Location:** Volkshotel, Wibautstraat 150 Amsterdam.

Please find details on the registration and the schedule below.

### Results 
The symposium will present the results of the applied research project Live Game Design (Live Intelligent Visual Environments for Game Design).
This includes technology, languages and tools for game design, the results of related student projects, and the results of the three case studies with companies: Ludomotion, Firebrush Studios and IC3D Media.

### Discussion
We also look forward to what's next.
What are the technical challenges Dutch game developers are facing?
How can applied research into visual programming languages, tools and procedural content generation help?
How can teams of students, lecturer/researchers and practitioners work together tackle these challenges in the coming years?

### Registration
Registration is required. Please contact us via (livegamedesign@gmail.com) before Tuesday February 12th if you wish to participate. Participation (including optional lunch) is free, but limited spaces are available.
